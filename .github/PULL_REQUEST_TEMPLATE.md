# Checklist

Before submitting your Pull Request, please see this checklist.
When not all points can be checked, then your PR is probably getting ignored!

If you're not done with your PR but have submitted it already,
please add a Work in Progress (`WIP: `) before the summary to make it clear.

* [ ] Have you followed the guidelines in our [Contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md) document?
* [ ] Have you checked to ensure there aren't other open [Pull Requests](../../../pulls) for the same update/change?
* [ ] Does the description of your PR reference the Issue?
* [ ] Is the code following the [Code Quality Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md#code-quality)?
